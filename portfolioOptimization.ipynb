    "## What is Portfolio Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portfolio Optimization** is the process of mathematically determining the optimal **position** (or allocation) in the risky asset (the market, S&P 500 excess returns) versus the risk-free asset (cash). The goal is to maximize a specific utility function or financial metric, such as the **Adjusted Sharpe Ratio**, subject to predefined constraints on the allocation size and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook defines the position as the allocation to the risky asset, where:\n",
    "* 0.0 MIN POSITION represents 0% in the market (i.e., 100% in the risk-free asset).\n",
    "* 1.0 represents 100% in the market (market neutral).\n",
    "* 2.0 MAX POSITION represents 200% in the market (a leveraged, aggressive position).\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall portfolio return is calculated based on this position:\n",
    "Strategy Return = (Risk-Free Rate * (1 - Position)) + (Position * Market Return)\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization itself is performed using numerical methods like **L-BFGS-B** (for Mean-Variance) and **SLSQP** (for constrained and Sharpe maximization problems) via the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function.\n",

    "## Role in the Hull Tactical Market Prediction Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "The central role of portfolio optimization in this competition is to achieve a trading strategy that **outperforms a simple buy-and-hold strategy** while adhering to a critical risk constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Primary Objective: Maximizing the Adjusted Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "The ultimate goal of the competition is to develop a strategy that yields the highest **Adjusted Sharpe Ratio**. The strategies (Mean-Variance, Minimum Variance, Sharpe Maximization, Risk Parity, CAPM Alpha Signal) all aim to find a series of daily positions that maximize this specific metric. The strategy that produces the highest Adjusted Sharpe Ratio on the historical data is declared the **Winner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Managing Volatility and Returns (The Adjusted Sharpe Penalties)\n",
    "The Adjusted Sharpe Ratio is the competition's core evaluation metric because it heavily **penalizes** strategies that violate two key constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Excess Volatility Penalty**: This penalty is applied if the strategy's volatility is greater than **120% of the market's volatility**. \n",
    "* **Return Penalty**: This penalty is applied if the strategy's geometric mean excess return **underperforms the market's return**. \n",
    "By optimizing directly for this metric (as in the **Sharpe Maximization** strategy), the portfolio optimization implicitly manages these constraints to secure the highest possible rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization process uses a **lookback window of 180 days** of historical data for all calculations, simulating the rolling window approach typically used in live trading. The final winning strategy is chosen as the one that yields the highest **Adjusted Sharpe Ratio** during this historical evaluation."
